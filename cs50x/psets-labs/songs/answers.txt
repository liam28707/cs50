1. I would characterize their audio aura by looking at the genre of songs most listened to as well as taking
into account the average energy, danceability and valence of the songs. SO if the listeners avg valence,
energy and danceability are high it could be characterized as high energy music.

2. This method of characterizing Audio Aura won't take into account the listeners favorite genres, or
perphaps the context to which that person was listening to certain types of music. Each persons emotion
set is unique and can't be characterized by three characteristics of songs. A better way to analyse
would be to try and infer context by understandind at which time during the day such songs were played or
use a genre- based analysis or take in direct User Feedback would be the most accurate without affecting
the User's personal space.
