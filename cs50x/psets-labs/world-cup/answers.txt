Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: When a 100000 or a 1000000
simulations are run, teams have a 0% chance at winning. So these are incorrect

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: A 1000 simulations, as its plausible enough
as each team as a justifiable amount of a possibility at winning the world cup
